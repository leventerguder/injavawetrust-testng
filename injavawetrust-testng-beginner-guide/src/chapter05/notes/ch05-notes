	dependency is a feature in TestNG that allows a test method to depend on
	a single or a group of test methods. This will help in executing a set of tests to be executed
	before a test method. Method dependency only works if the depend-on-method is part of
	the same class or any of the inherited base class (that is, while extending a class).
	
	
	The dependency can be configured for both test methods and also for groups. We can
	even configure/define a dependency through the testng XML suite file. Use of regular
	expressions is supported for groups and can be used for name-based search to add
	groups to dependency.
