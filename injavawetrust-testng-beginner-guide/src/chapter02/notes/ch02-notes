	testng.xml is a configuration file for TestNG. It is used to define test suites and tests
	in TestNG. It is also used to pass parameters to test methods.
	
	testng.xml provides different options to include packages, classes, and independent test
	methods in our test suite.
	
	TestNG allows you to do the following:
	
	 - Create tests with packages
	 - Create tests using classes
	 - Create tests using test methods
	 - Include/exclude a particular package, class, or test method
	 - Use of regular expression while using the include/exclude feature
	 - Store parameter values for passing to test methods at runtime
	 - Configure multithreaded execution options
