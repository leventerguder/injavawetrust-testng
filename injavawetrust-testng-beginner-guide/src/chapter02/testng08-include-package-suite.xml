<!-- TestNG provides the flexibility to include or exclude tests while defining 
	a test suite -->


<!-- The preceding test suite defines a test, which includes all sub packages 
	of the chapter02.examples package (defined by using regular expression chapter02.examples.*) 
	and includes only a particular package from all the packages for test execution. 
	This is done by using the include tag with the name attribute value as the 
	package name that needs to be included (that is, chapter02.examples.pack02). 
	This informs TestNG to include classes belonging to the included package 
	for test execution. -->
