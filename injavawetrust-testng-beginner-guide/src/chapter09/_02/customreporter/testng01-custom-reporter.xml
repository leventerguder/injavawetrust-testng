	<!-- The preceding example shows a simple custom reporter which prints the 
		number of failed, passed, and skipped tests on the console for each suite 
		included the said test execution. Reporter is mainly used to generate the 
		final report for the test execution. The extension can be used to generate 
		XML, HTML, XLS, CSV, or text format files depending upon the report requirement. -->


	<!-- The report is generated by default under the folder named test-output 
		and can be changed to any other folder by configuring it. These reports consist 
		of certain HTML and XML reports that are TestNG specific. -->
