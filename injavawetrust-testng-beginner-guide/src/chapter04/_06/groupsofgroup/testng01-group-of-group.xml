	<!-- Two groups of groups have been defined inside the test, and then these 
		groups are used for test execution. The MetaGroup is created using the define 
		tag inside the groups tag as shown in the previous code. The name of the 
		new group is defined using the name attribute under the define tag. Groups 
		are included and excluded from the new group by using the include and exclude 
		tags. -->
