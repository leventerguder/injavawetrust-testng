	What is factory?
	Sometimes we may need to run a set of tests with different data values. To achieve this
	we may define a separate set of tests inside a suite in the testng XML and test the
	required scenario. The problem with this approach is that, if you get an extra set of data,
	you will need to redefine the test. TestNG solves this problem by providing the @Factory
	annotation feature. Factory in TestNG defines and creates tests dynamically at runtime.
	
	The DataProvider feature can also be used with the @Factory annotation for creating tests
	at runtime. This can be done by declaring the @Factory annotation on a constructor of a
	class or on a regular method.
	
	
		- DataProvider: A test method that uses DataProvider will be executed a
	multiple number of times based on the data provided by the DataProvider.
	The test method will be executed using the same instance of the test class
	to which the test method belongs.
	
		- Factory: A factory will execute all the test methods present inside a test class
	using a separate instance of the respective class.
