	Parallelism or multithreading in software terms is defined as the ability of the software,
	operating system, or program to execute multiple parts or subcomponents of another
	program simultaneously.
	
	Parallelism or multithreaded execution can provide a lot of advantages to the users.
	The following are two:
	
		- Reduces execution time: As tests are executed in parallel, multiple tests get
	executed simultaneously, hence reducing the overall time taken to execute the tests
	
		- Allows multithreaded tests: Using this feature, we can write tests to verify certain
	multithreaded code in the applications
	
	This feature is vastly used by the QA industry for functional automation testing. This feature
	helps QA guys configure their tests to be executed easily in multiple browsers or operating
	systems simultaneously.
