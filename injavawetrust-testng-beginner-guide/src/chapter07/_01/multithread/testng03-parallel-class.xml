<!-- We have successfully created a test suite, which is executed in multithreaded 
	or parallel mode. Here for executing each class in parallel we have configured 
	TestNG by providing the value classes to the parallel attribute of suite. 
	Also the test is configured to spawn two threads for the said test suite; 
	this is done by providing the value 2 to the thread-count at the suite level. 
	The previous test result clearly shows that each test class and its respective 
	beforeClass and afterClass methods are executed in a different thread. This 
	is identified by the id of the thread that is printed on the console. -->
