<!-- We have successfully created a test class, which is executed in multithreaded 
	or parallel mode. Here, for executing the tests in parallel we have configured 
	TestNG to run test methods in parallel by providing the value methods to 
	the parallel attribute of suite. Also the test is configured to spawn two 
	threads for the said test suite; this is done by providing the value 2 to 
	the thread-count attribute at the suite level. The previous test result clearly 
	shows that each test method and its respective before and after method is 
	executed in a different thread. This is identified by the ID of the thread 
	that is printed on the console. -->
